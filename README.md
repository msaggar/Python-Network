Overlay Routing & Distributed Transaction Processing

In this project, you will apply what you have learned throughout the semester to build an overlay
routing system that uses Link State routing to pass messages between arbitrary nodes.
Overlay routing is routing that happens at the application layer. The application layer
processes on a given node, connect to application layer processes on other nodes to build routing
tables and pass messages.

Your task is to implement an application layer protocol using the fact that nodes know how to
communicate with their direct neighbors. Using this simple fact, you will enable communication
between arbitrary nodes. Your code will run at the application layer. Instances applications running
on dierent nodes will be able to communicate with instances running on other nodes. Put another
way, instances of your application will be able to communicate across nodes.
